# Basic Examples

Here we provide a few examples to get you started with Predibase. These examples are designed to be easy to follow and
provide a quick introduction to the main features of Predibase. Each example is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook that
provides a walkthrough of the code and its output. You can run these examples on Google Colab or on your local machine.

* ### Fine-tuning LLaMa2-7B for Text Classification
> Get started with fine-tuning using our quickstart example. Here you will fine-tune LLaMa2-7B on the open source
> [consumer complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selener/consumer-complaint-database) dataset from Kaggle.


* ### Fine-tuning Deep Dive
> This example is a more in-depth look at fine-tuning. Here you will fine-tune LLaMa2-7B on the 
> [Code Alpaca dataset](https://github.com/sahil280114/codealpaca) in order do improve the LLMs ability to follow 
> instructions for producing code from natural language.
