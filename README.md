# Predibase Examples

## Basic Examples

Here we provide a few examples to get you started with Predibase. These examples are designed to be easy to follow and
provide a quick introduction to the main features of Predibase. Each example is a self-contained Jupyter Notebook that
provides a walkthrough of the code and its output. You can run these examples on Google Colab or on your local machine.
    
* ### Fine-tuning Intro
> Get started with fine-tuning using our quickstart example. Here you will fine-tune LLaMa2-7B on the open source 
> [consumer complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/selener/consumer-complaint-database) dataset from Kaggle.


* ### Fine-tuning Deep Dive
> This example is a more in-depth look at fine-tuning. Here you will fine-tune LLaMa2-7B on the open source

## Personalized Email Campaigns

In this example, we train a recommender system model to predict the likelihood of a user purchasing a product based on
their past product interactions. We then pass the output of this model to a Predibase hosted LLM to generate 
personalized email outreach campaigns specific to each user. This example will show you both how to train the
recommender system model and how to chain the outputs with Predibase LLM capabilities.
